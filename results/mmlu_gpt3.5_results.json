By retrieving relevant external knowledge and iteratively reflecting on the reasoning process, we can create a more comprehensive problem-solving approach.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture involves retrieving relevant knowledge from external sources and using it to reason about the task. The retrieved knowledge will help break down complex problems into more familiar scenarios, facilitating better reasoning. After retrieving knowledge, a meta-cognitive agent will reflect on the reasoning process and provide insights based on these reflections. An iterative refinement process will be used to improve the solutions, and a final synthesis agent will integrate all refined outputs to provide the final answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Knowledge Retrieval Agent:** Fetches relevant information from external knowledge sources based on the task.\n2. **Meta-Cognitive Agent:** Reflects on the reasoning process and identifies potential improvements.\n3. **Iterative Refinement:** Refines the initial solutions using the retrieved knowledge and reflections from the meta-cognitive agent.\n4. **Synthesis Agent:** Integrates the refined outputs to provide the final answer.",
